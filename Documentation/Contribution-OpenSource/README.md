# Contribution

If you want to contribute to this open source project, you are very welcome.

However, we ask you to consider the following points:

1. there will be a multitude of possible extensions, additions and adaptations that seem to make sense in the very different usage scenarios. Not all of these additions will be implementable without contradiction for all missions.
   Only generalised functions can be integrated - if necessary, the use of an additional extension with supplements is a good idea. At the moment, the possibility of hooks is missing.
2. for the frontend programming we have deposited linting rules (see the path mentioned above). Please use a linting for css and javascript, so that the automatic build processes are not disturbed.
3. for the PHP code we have deposited TYPO3 rules for the php-cs-fixer. Also use this function before the merge request.
   More information and parameters about [php-cs-fixer - TYPO3 coding standards](https://github.com/TYPO3/coding-standards)
4. before you invest a lot of work (also because of the points mentioned above), we would appreciate a ticket. Maybe adjustments have already been started or implemented in other forks. Simple rule: "Let's talk first!"
