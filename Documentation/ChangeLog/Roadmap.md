- Analysis and, if necessary, correction of previously unexplained errors, s. - [Known issues](./Known-issues.md)

## open features
- Archiving proposals (including cleaning the database, retaining summary data).
- Deletion of data and accounts that have been present longer than specified. It should be possible to send info e-mails for accounts (x days in advance).
