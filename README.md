## Version
The current version is 1.1

## Note
This version of the extension is not in productive use, but contains the current code.
However, we are currently (still) using another extension to extend fe-users to be able to use this data in the open-oap extension. There is currently no solution without this extension. It is also not freely available. If you are interested, please let us know and we can deliver it.
